            <p class="s-description text-justify"  >
      CerG (ceramic material and glasses) was defined as a group of materials which can be mutually recycled. ceramic materials and glasses are distinguished because ceramic materials are crystalline solids and glasses are amorphous solids. Hereafter the recycling of those materials by melting or sintering was taken into consideration. In practice, when waste CerG is recycled to produce new CerG materials, the chemical compositions of recovered waste CerG have to meet requirements of the target CerG material. When a substance that should be strictly avoided in a CerG material is contained in a waste CerG, the waste CerG cannot be recycled as a CerG material.            </p>

            <h2 class="s-title">E-WASTE</h2>
            <p class="s-description text-justify">
    After sorting , recycling  involves a serious labor intensive process of manual dismantling. The e-waste items are taken apart to retrieve all the parts and then categorized into core materials and components. items that cannot be dismantled efficiently are shredded together with the other dismantled parts to pieces less than 2 inches in diameter. The well spread out e-waste pieces are then broken down further. over-band magnet is used to remove all the magnetic materials including steel and iron from the e-waste debris. The next step is the separation of metals and non-metallic components. Copper, aluminum, and brass are separated from the debris to only leave behind non-metallic materials. The metals are either sold as raw materials or re-used for fresh manufacture. As the last step, plastic content is separated from glass by use of water. One separated, all the materials retrieved can then be resold as raw materials for re-use. The products sold include plastic, glass, copper, iron, steel, shredded circuit boards, and valuable metal mix.

The textile waste material industries include shoddy manufacturers, who recycle or remanufacture wool; laundry and wiping rag producer, who manufacture recycled rags for cleaning purposes; sorted clothing, which involves used clothing; shredders, who destroy the waste and reproduce it via recycling; garnetters are involved in the garneting process, which includes the recovering of fibres from hard twisted waste, rags and fragments. Under this process the materials return to a fluffy fibrous condition so it can be reused in blends. The process of garnetting involves use of machines. The process includes: sorting used woollens, cutting out the labels in the garments, loading to chopper each stage of garneting involves use of finer-toothed mesh, followed by fibrous stage, removing the button, preparing fibre webs, spinning the yarn, preparing yarn for weaving and finishing the blankets.            </p>

            <p class="s-description text-justify">
              The separated paper is  washed with soapy water to remove inks, plastic film, staples and glue. The paper is put into a large holder where it is mixed with water to create ‘slurry’. By adding different materials to the slurry, different paper products can be created, such as cardboard, newsprints or office paper. The slurry is spread using large rollers into large thin sheets. The paper is left to dry, and then it is rolled up ready to be cut and sent back to the shops.

            <p class="s-description text-justify">
        Broadly, there are two major ways to recycle plastic: (1) mechanical recycling ("chop and wash", where the plastic is washed, ground into powders and melted, and (2) chemical recycling, where the plastic is broken down into basic components. After sorting, for mechanical recycling the plastic recyclables are then shredded. These shredded fragments then undergo processes to eliminate impurities like paper labels. This material is melted and often extruded into the form of pellets which are then used to manufacture other products.          </div>

            <p class="s-description text-justify">
              Pick up the wood from the front of the classifier using a front end loader. Expose the wood to industrial magnets to separate any metal from the mix.
              Move the material to the tub grinder, horizontal grinder or wood chipper. Grind the wood into chips to be sold for use in particle board, chipboard, pulp and paper products, animal bedding, mulch, biomass fuel and compost.
